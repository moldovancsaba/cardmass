We will log planning and delivery decisions here during Warp AI sessions.

- 2025-09-12T07:59:06.000Z — Planned full scaffold, DB, CRUD API, and 3-column UI with backlog composer.
- 2025-09-13T00:00:00.000Z — Plan: Normalize kanban/matrix layout to prevent BottomBar overflow; wrap pages in full-height flex containers and set Board root to md:h-full. Update ROADMAP and TASKLIST accordingly.
- 2025-09-13T17:03:56.586Z — Major update v2.0.0: Centralized BottomBar across pages; xl-only no-scroll wrappers; matrix 2x2 grid now fits above BottomBar with internal scrolling per quadrant.
