Plan — Adopt MessMass Zero-Trust Authentication & Access for Cardmass
- Source: https://github.com/moldovancsaba/messmass/blob/main/AUTHENTICATION_AND_ACCESS.md
- Summary: Implement admin-session (HttpOnly cookie) + per-page passwords (MD5-style) with a zero-trust rule: protected endpoints allow access iff (admin session) OR (valid page password for the requested page). Client prompts are UX only; all decisions enforced server-side.
- Scope (initial): Tagger board pages and related data APIs; future: Creator and org admin as admin-only.
- Compliance: All timestamps ISO 8601 with milliseconds, no tests, no breadcrumbs; update docs (ROADMAP/TASKLIST/ARCHITECTURE) accordingly.

High-level phases
1) Data & helpers
   - users collection (admin users), pagePasswords collection (pageId, pageType, password, createdAt, usageCount)
   - lib/auth.ts: decodeSessionToken, getAdminUser, isAuthenticated
   - lib/pagePassword.ts: generateMD5StylePassword, getOrCreatePagePassword, validatePagePassword, validateAnyPassword
2) API endpoints
   - POST/DELETE /api/admin/login (login/logout) — set/delete admin-session cookie
   - GET /api/auth/check — verify admin session
   - POST /api/page-passwords — create/retrieve password + shareableLink
   - PUT /api/page-passwords — validate password (admin bypass)
3) UI gating
   - components/PasswordGate.tsx — prompt and PUT validation for non-admin viewers
   - Integrate into /{org}/{board}/tagger (pageType: 'tagger', pageId: boardUUID)
4) Server enforcement
   - Protected APIs: check admin-session; if absent, require pageId/pageType/password and validate on the server; reject otherwise
   - Short-term: allow UI-only gating while migrating; long-term: require X-Page-Password + X-Page-Id + X-Page-Type headers for non-admin requests
5) Operations & docs
   - Cookie hardening (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure in prod); ISO timestamps; never leak secrets
   - Update ARCHITECTURE with "Authentication & Access" section; keep ROADMAP/TASKLIST current

Acceptance
- Tagger page locked for non-admins without valid page password
- Admin users bypass password once logged in
- Protected APIs enforce the zero-trust rule server-side
- Docs updated; build remains green

Delivery — Board background CSS + Area styling refinements (v0.17.0)
- Added: Per-board background CSS field (Creator → Boards API → Tagger). Only background-* declarations are applied for safety.
- Changed: Area bgColor is independent of hashtag color; Tagger uses bgColor tint only. Removed area border; added 4px top padding before grid; increased inter-area gap.
- Governance: Synchronized docs and version; build verified.

Plan — Masonry (Pinterest-like) for Tagger multi-column areas without breaking DnD
- What: Use CSS multi-column inside each area when areaCols > 1 (columnWidth = cardWidth; columnGap = 8px; items break-inside: avoid).
- Why: True masonry-like packing with minimal gaps; no JS reflow; DOM order preserved for accessibility and DnD stability.
- DnD: Preserve existing behavior — in multi-column, only top-of-area and end-of-grid slots; in single-column, between-card slots remain; inbox drop unchanged; stopPropagation rules intact.
- Area rules: Respect current area width computation and rowFirst in grid mode; rowFirst has no effect in multicol mode.
- Rollback: Feature-flag ENABLE_MASONRY for instant revert.
- Governance: Log plan in ROADMAP/TASKLIST; implement CSS-only change; update docs; follow versioning protocol (patch before dev; minor before commit) with ISO 8601 ms timestamps.

Fix — Allow drops into middle of lists reliably; bump to 0.6.9 (dev)
- Do not override slot hints at area level: removed setDropHint from area onDragOver.
- Stop event propagation on slot dragOver/drop so parent onDrop doesn’t hijack the drop.
- Result: Dropping between any two cards works consistently with correct insertion order.

Plan — Enforce global minimum text size baseline (text-sm)
- What: Override small text utilities (text-xs, text-[10px], text-[11px], text-[12px], small) to at least 0.875rem (14px) globally.
- Why: Product requirement to make hashtags, admin microcopy, and any small text legible and consistent with Inbox card content size.
- Governance: Bump to v0.8.0, update docs with ISO 8601 ms timestamps.

Plan — Replace card action labels with Material Symbols icons

# WARP.DEV_AI_CONVERSATION

Timestamp: 2025-09-27T17:19:16.000Z
Author: ai

Plan — Resolve Next.js font warnings and type-check path issues
- What: Keep Material Symbols link in app/layout.tsx with display=optional; disable @next/next/no-page-custom-font for this file.
- Why: App Router uses root layout; this avoids the page-only font warning while keeping font loading simple.
- Also: Guarded useSearchParams nullability in CreatorApp to satisfy strict TS checks.
- Governance: Bump to v0.10.0; update docs with ISO timestamps.
- What: Load Google Fonts Material Symbols and replace card action labels 'open, archive, edit, del' with icons 'pageview, archive, edit_note, delete' in both Inbox and placed cards.
- Why: Cleaner UI, consistent iconography.
- Governance: Bump version to v0.9.0, update docs and release notes with ISO timestamps.
- Card page: remove page title and status/order; split created/updated to separate lines; remove action buttons; render all hashtags as a single comma-separated list (deduped, lowercase, excluding 'spock').
- Global behavior: make all Card page links open in a new tab with target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer".
- Governance: bump MINOR to 0.7.0 before commit, update README/ROADMAP/TASKLIST/ARCHITECTURE/LEARNINGS with ISO 8601 timestamps (ms).

Plan — Card fine-tuning: bottom action bar, no overlays on cards; bump to 0.6.5 (dev)
- Move card operation buttons to the bottom below hashtags in both Inbox and area cards: open, archive, edit, del.
- Remove absolute-positioned action overlays; ensure text and elements do not overlay card content.
- Governance: bump version to 0.6.5 and sync documentation (ISO 8601 timestamps with ms).

Plan update — Archive board semantics and visibility
- Server: cards list supports archived=only | include | default(exclude). Default keeps archived hidden from normal boards; "archive" board requests archived-only.
- Client: Tagger detects board slug 'archive' and fetches archived=only cards there. Archived cards keep previous hashtags; Archive board can have its own areas and cards default to Inbox there.
- Governance: bump dev version to 0.6.4 and sync docs.

Plan summary — Colored hashtags on Card page; SPOCK nav hamburger + 3 recents; bump to 0.6.2 (dev)
- Card page: Render colored hashtags by fetching board areas for referenced boards and applying per-area colors/textBlack.
- Tagger/SPOCK nav: Always show a hamburger first; display the 3 most recently visited boards next to it; show the rest in a dropdown when hamburger is clicked; track recents per org in localStorage.
- Governance: Bump version to 0.6.2 (pre-dev) and sync docs with ISO 8601 timestamps (ms).

Action plan — Fix Tagger type import; enable Inbox drop; add Archive on Card page; bump to 0.6.1 (dev)
- Fix: In tagger/page.tsx, import Area via `import type` to avoid runtime binding emission and Next.js module error.
- Feature: In TaggerApp, make Inbox a drop target; on drop, call placeCard(id, '', undefined) to unset placement for this board.
- Feature: Add Archive button on Card page to PATCH { isArchived: true } and redirect to /{orgUUID}.
- Governance: Bump version to 0.6.1 before dev; update README/ARCHITECTURE/ROADMAP/TASKLIST/LEARNINGS; ISO 8601 timestamps with ms.

Plan summary — Card archive + open page link
- Add Card.isArchived (boolean) to hide cards from all list views without deleting; filter GET list to exclude archived; PATCH supports toggling.
- Add archive controls to Tagger (Inbox items and placed items) to set isArchived=true and optimistically remove from UI.
- Ensure dedicated Card page at /{orgUUID}/cards/{cardUUID} for sharing; add "open" button to Tagger items linking there.
- Update ROADMAP and TASKLIST with ISO timestamps; bump docs version to 0.6.0 (minor feature).
