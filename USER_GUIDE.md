## What is CardMass?

CardMass is a **multi-dimensional card classification system** that lets you organize items (cards) across multiple boards, with each board representing a different dimension or perspective.

### Use Cases

### Key Features

- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant architecture (organizations)
- ‚úÖ N-dimensional classification (multiple boards per card)
- ‚úÖ Drag-and-drop interface
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates
- ‚úÖ Board sharing with passwords
- ‚úÖ Visual hashtags showing card positions
- ‚úÖ Flexible grid layouts

---

## Core Concepts

### üè¢ **Organization**

An **organization** is the top-level container for all your data. Each organization has:
- Unique identifier (UUID)
- Name and optional description
- Its own set of boards, cards, and users

**Example**: Your company, team, or personal workspace

### üìã **Board**

A **board** represents **one dimension** of classification. Each board has:
- A grid of **areas** (labeled territories)
- A specific perspective or criterion
- Optional background styling
- Unique identifier (UUID)

**Example Boards**:
- Priority Board (areas: High, Medium, Low)
- Complexity Board (areas: Simple, Moderate, Complex)
- Impact Board (areas: High Impact, Medium Impact, Low Impact)

### üé¥ **Card**

A **card** is a single item you want to classify. Cards:
- Contain text content
- Can be placed on **multiple boards**
- Show hashtags indicating their position on other boards
- Can be dragged between areas
- Can be archived when no longer needed

**Example**: "Implement user authentication" (a feature or task)

### üìç **Area**

An **area** is a labeled territory on a board where cards can be placed. Areas:
- Have a label (e.g., "High Priority", "Complex", "Low Impact")
- Can have custom background colors
- Define the classification on that dimension

**Example**: On a Priority Board, you might have areas: "Critical", "High", "Medium", "Low"

### üññ **Spock Area (Inbox)**

The **Spock area** is a special virtual inbox that:
- Appears on every board automatically
- Contains cards **not yet placed** on that specific board
- Is never saved to the database (virtual only)
- Named after the character from Star Trek (logical, organized)

**Why "Spock"?**: When you create a card or view a board, cards without a placement on that board appear in Spock - it's your "to be classified" inbox for that dimension.

## Understanding Areas

### What is an Area?

An **area** is a labeled space on a board where cards can be placed. Think of it as a category or classification bucket for that board's dimension.

### Area Properties

Each area has:

1. **Label**: The classification name (e.g., "High Priority")
2. **Background Color** (optional): Visual distinction
3. **Text Color** (optional): For readability
4. **Position**: Row/column in the grid

### Styling Areas

**In Creator Mode**:

1. Click on an area
2. Set:
   - **Label**: Classification name
   - **BgColor**: Hex color code (e.g., #FF5733)
   - **Text Color**: Black or white for contrast
   - **Row First**: Dense packing preference
3. Save board

**Visual Feedback**:
- Area backgrounds tint cards at 70% opacity
- Hashtags show the area color from other boards
- Cards visually "belong" to their area

---

## The Spock Area (Inbox)

### What is Spock?

**Spock** is a virtual inbox area that appears on every board. It contains cards that **don't have a placement** on that specific board yet.

### Why "Spock"?

Named after Mr. Spock from Star Trek:
- Logical and organized
- Temporary holding place
- Encourages classification (being logical about where things belong)

### How Spock Works

1. **Appears Automatically**: Every board has a Spock area (top-left)
2. **Virtual Only**: Spock is never saved to the database
3. **Per-Board**: Each board's Spock shows different cards
4. **Dynamic**: As you place cards, they leave Spock

### When Cards Appear in Spock

A card appears in Spock on a board when:
- Card was just created (no placements yet)
- Card has placements on other boards but not this one
- Card was removed from all areas on this board

### Working with Spock

**Viewing Spock Cards**:
- Spock area is always visible (unless collapsed)
- Shows count of unplaced cards
- Displays cards in a list/grid

**Classifying from Spock**:
1. Drag card from Spock
2. Drop onto an area
3. Card leaves Spock (now classified)
4. Hashtag appears for this board

**Collapsing Spock**:
- Click the collapse button (if available)
- Cards expand to use full width
- Toggle back to show Spock

---

## N-Dimensional Classification

### What is N-Dimensional Classification?

CardMass allows you to classify **the same card** on **multiple boards**, with each board representing a different dimension.

### Example: Task Classification

**Card**: "Implement user authentication"

**Dimensions** (Boards):
1. **Priority Board** ‚Üí Placed in "High" area
2. **Complexity Board** ‚Üí Placed in "Complex" area
3. **Impact Board** ‚Üí Placed in "High Impact" area
4. **Resources Board** ‚Üí Placed in "Backend Team" area

### How It Works

1. Create a card on any board
2. Card appears in **Spock** on all other boards
3. Drag card from Spock to area on each board
4. Each placement is independent
5. Hashtags show positions on other boards

### Viewing All Dimensions

**From Tagger View**:
- Hover over card to see hashtags
- Each hashtag represents a position on another board
- Hashtag color matches the area color

**From Card Detail**:
- Click on card to open detail modal
- See all board placements listed
- Navigate to other boards from modal

### Benefits of N-Dimensional Classification

- **Multi-perspective analysis**: View items from multiple angles
- **Better decision making**: Consider multiple criteria
- **Flexible organization**: Not locked into single categorization
- **Visual insights**: Hashtags provide quick overview

## Tips and Best Practices

### Board Design

‚úÖ **Keep grids manageable**: 3√ó3 or 4√ó4 works well  
‚úÖ **Use clear labels**: Make area names obvious  
‚úÖ **Consistent dimensions**: Similar classification types across boards  
‚úÖ **Color coding**: Use colors meaningfully (red = urgent, green = good)  

‚ùå **Avoid**: Too many areas (hard to distinguish)  
‚ùå **Avoid**: Vague labels like "Other" or "Misc"  

### Card Management

‚úÖ **Concise text**: Keep card content brief and clear  
‚úÖ **One concept per card**: Don't combine unrelated items  
‚úÖ **Regular classification**: Process Spock regularly  
‚úÖ **Archive old cards**: Keep boards current  

‚ùå **Avoid**: Long paragraphs in cards  
‚ùå **Avoid**: Duplicate cards across organizations  

### Organization

‚úÖ **Meaningful dimensions**: Each board should represent a distinct perspective  
‚úÖ **Complete classification**: Place cards on all relevant boards  
‚úÖ **Review regularly**: Update placements as priorities change  
‚úÖ **Use hashtags**: Quick visual reference for multi-board positions  

### Workflow Suggestions

**Daily**:
- Check Spock areas for new cards
- Classify unplaced cards
- Review and adjust priorities

**Weekly**:
- Review all boards for outdated cards
- Archive completed items
- Adjust placements based on changes

**Monthly**:
- Audit board structure
- Consider new dimensions (boards)
- Clean up archived cards

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: Cards don't appear on a board**  
A: Check if card is archived. Archived cards don't show in Tagger views.

**Q: Can't drag cards**  
A: Ensure you have edit permissions. Check if board is password-protected and you're authenticated.

**Q: Hashtags not showing**  
A: Hashtags only appear when card is placed on multiple boards. Place card on another board to see hashtags.

**Q: Spock area is empty but I have cards**  
A: All cards are already placed on this board. Check the areas for your cards.

**Q: Lost password for a board**  
A: Contact an admin to regenerate the password via the üîë button.

**Q: Changes not saving**  
A: Check your network connection. Changes save automatically but require active connection.
